     * QUESTION 1
     * Create a class hierarchy for vehicles. The base class should be Vehicle,
     * and it should have the following properties and methods:
     * Properties: manufacturer (String), year (int)
     * Methods: accelerate() (prints "Vehicle accelerating"),
     * brake() (prints "Vehicle braking"),
     * toString() (returns a string representation of the vehicle)
     * The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and add the following properties and methods:
     * Properties: numDoors (int)
     * Methods: openDoors() (prints "Opening car doors")
     * Create instances of the Vehicle and Car classes,
     * and demonstrate the usage of the methods and properties.
     * Check Main, Car, and Vehicle Classes for answers
     */

    /**
     * Question 2:
     *
     * Create an interface called Shape with the following methods:
     *
     * calculateArea() (returns the area of the shape as a double)
     * display() (prints the shape's details)
     * Implement the Shape interface in two classes: Rectangle and Circle.
     * The Rectangle class should have properties for width and height,
     * while the Circle class should have a property for the radius.
     * Provide implementations for the methods in each class.
     * Create instances of Rectangle and Circle, and demonstrate the usage of the methods.
     * Check Main, Shape,Rectangle and Circle Classes for answers

     *  QUESTION 3
     *  Write  pass and failing JUnit test cases for a methods in a class
     *  called MathUtils that does all the calculations add, sub,
     *  multiply and modulo. One of the  test cases should cover an assert throw
     *  for the method
     *  Check MathUtils and MathUtilsTest for answers
