     * Question 1:
     * Imagine you are developing a game that involves different player classes.
     * Each player class has a unique skill associated with it.
     * Design an enum for the player classes and create a method that returns the skill based on the selected player class.
     * Handle any exceptions that might occur during the process.
     * Check Game And Player Class For Solution
     *
     *
     *
     * Question 2:
     * Suppose you are developing a calculator program in Java.
     * Implement a method called divideNumbers() that accepts two integers as parameters
     * and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number.
     * However, handle the potential exceptions that might occur during the division process.
     * If the second number is zero, throw a custom exception called DivideByZeroException.
     * In the main() method, call the divideNumbers() method with different inputs, and handle any exceptions that may arise.
     * Check DivideByZeroException class and Calculator class For solutions
